Hi! I am RuoHan, a research student currently working in [Ben Seymour's lab]()on Pain and Aversive Learning. Our lab is based at the [Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience]()_in Oxford University. My project
looks at the distinctive properties of 'postive pain' or that the pain that is objectivelly perceived as painful but can be subjectively associated with positiveness or even reward. For instance, exercise related muscle
soreness should , in theory, be unpleasant. However, it is usual that people perceive it as an edorsement of progress and effectiveness of their previous workout. Studying the neuroscience of 'positive pain' could potentially 
help us develop neurofeedback training programs to help chronic pain patients dissociate pain from 'injury, damage and depressive emotions' and thereby aid rehabilitation from this clinical case which drastically reduces quality of life in patients.
